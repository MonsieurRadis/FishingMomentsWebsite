    <h2 data-i18n="supportFaqTitle">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 data-i18n="faqForecastTitle">How does the forecast work?</h3>
      <p data-i18n="faqForecastAnswer">Fishing Moments calculates activity scores for each species based on multiple environmental factors: solunar periods (moon position), barometric pressure, water temperature estimates, wind, precipitation, and species-specific biological rhythms. Each species has its own behavior model reflecting its real sensitivity to these conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 data-i18n="faqSpeciesTitle">Why are forecasts different for each species?</h3>
      <p data-i18n="faqSpeciesAnswer">Because fish don't all react the same way. Pike love cold fronts and pressure drops. Carp prefer warm, stable weather. Trout are sensitive to water temperature. Our models are calibrated per species to reflect these real biological differences.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 data-i18n="faqAccuracyTitle">How accurate are the forecasts?</h3>
      <p data-i18n="faqAccuracyAnswer">The forecasts are based on well-established ichthyological research and solunar theory. While no prediction can be 100% accurate (fishing remains fishing!), our users report significantly better catch rates when following the app's recommendations.</p>
