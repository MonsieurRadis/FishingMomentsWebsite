Catch and release fishing is one of the most important habits modern anglers can adopt.

It allows us to enjoy the sport, target large fish, and preserve healthy populations for the future. But catch and release only works when it is done correctly.

Done properly, survival rates can exceed 90–95%. Done poorly, fish may swim away — only to die hours or days later from stress, injury, or infection.

Ethical fishing is not just about letting fish go. It is about ensuring they survive.

## Why Catch and Release Matters

Fish populations across Europe face real pressure: overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and rising water temperatures.

Catch and release helps reduce harvest pressure while still allowing anglers to experience the sport.

Large predator fish such as pike, carp, and trout are especially valuable breeders. Releasing them maintains genetic strength and population stability.

However, the responsibility sits with us. If fish are handled poorly, delayed mortality increases dramatically.

**The goal is not just release. The goal is survival.**

## Before You Fish: Set Up for Success

### Barbless Hooks
Use barbless hooks whenever possible. They reduce tissue damage, speed up unhooking, and minimize handling time.

### Unhooking Tools Ready
Have forceps, pliers, or a disgorger prepared and within reach. Searching through your bag while a fish lies exposed increases stress.

### Landing Net Choice
Use a rubberized or knotless mesh net. Traditional nylon nets remove protective slime and can damage fins.

### Unhooking Mat (For Larger Fish)
If targeting carp or pike, use a wet unhooking mat. Never place large fish directly on dry grass, gravel, or rocks.

### Hook Material
Avoid stainless steel hooks. If a fish breaks off, standard carbon steel hooks degrade over time.

## During the Fight

How you fight a fish determines how well it survives.

### Do Not Play Fish to Exhaustion
Long fights build lactic acid in fish muscle tissue. An exhausted fish in warm water may not recover.

### Oversized Gear Is Safer Than Undersized
Using slightly heavier line and tackle shortens fight time. Bringing a fish in steadily is better than allowing a 10–15 minute struggle.

In warm water (above 20°C), this becomes critical. Fish already face oxygen stress in [summer](/blog/summer-fishing-beat-the-heat/). Prolonged fights dramatically increase mortality risk.

For more on high-temperature concerns, see [trout temperature guide](/blog/trout-water-temperature-guide/).

**A shorter, controlled fight equals a stronger release.**

## Handling the Fish

### Wet Your Hands
Always wet your hands before touching a fish. Fish are coated in a protective slime layer that defends against infection. Dry hands remove this barrier.

### Support the Fish Properly
Support fish horizontally. Use one hand under the belly and one supporting near the tail. Never hold fish vertically by the jaw alone.

### Avoid the Gills
Never place fingers inside gills. Gill tissue is delicate and damage is often fatal.

### Minimize Air Exposure
Keep air exposure under 30 seconds. Prepare your camera first. Lift the fish briefly. Take the photo. Return it to water.

### Hold Fish Low
When photographing, hold fish close to the water or mat. Dropping a fish from even half a meter can cause internal injuries.

**The golden rule: water is home. Keep them in it as much as possible.**

## Unhooking

### Lip-Hooked Fish
These are ideal. Back the hook out gently. Barbless hooks make this nearly effortless.

### Deep-Hooked Fish
Use long forceps or a disgorger. Do not pull aggressively. If the hook is deeply embedded in the throat or stomach, **cut the line as close as possible and leave the hook**. Attempting to remove a deep hook often causes catastrophic internal damage. Carbon hooks corrode naturally over time.

### Gill-Hooked Fish
If bleeding heavily from the gills, survival chances decrease. Minimize handling. Release immediately.

**Barbless hooks dramatically reduce deep hooking incidents. Ethical fishing begins with prevention.**

## Releasing the Fish

### Hold Upright
Place the fish upright in the water. Support the belly.

### Face Into Current (If in River)
Hold the fish facing upstream. Water flowing through the gills accelerates oxygen recovery.

### Do Not Push Back and Forth
Let water flow naturally.

### Wait for Strength
When the fish kicks strongly and maintains balance, release your support. Do not throw or drop fish.

### If Fish Rolls Belly-Up
Gently right it and continue supporting until it regains equilibrium. In rivers, release fish in calmer water near the bank — not directly into strong current.

---

## Temperature Considerations

### Warm Water (Above 20°C)
Handle even faster. Shorten fights. Reduce air exposure to the absolute minimum. For sensitive species such as [trout](/blog/trout-water-temperature-guide/), consider not fishing when water exceeds safe limits.

### Cold Water
Cold water holds more oxygen. Fish recover more slowly but are less physiologically stressed.

### Air Temperature
Never lay fish on hot rocks, dry sand, or frozen ground. Extreme surfaces damage skin and internal tissue.

## Teaching Responsible Angling

If you fish with children or beginners, demonstrate correct fish handling from the start.

For a full beginner overview, see [freshwater fishing for beginners](/blog/freshwater-fishing-beginners-guide/).

Normalize: wet hands, short air exposure, barbless hooks, quick releases. Ethical fishing culture protects future fishing opportunities.

## Conclusion

Catch and release fishing is powerful — but only if practiced properly.

Prepare before fishing. Fight fish efficiently. Handle gently. Minimize air exposure. Release with care. Adjust for temperature.

Every fish you release properly is one that breeds, grows, and gives another angler a great day. **Fishing Moments** helps you fish at the right times — which means less time waiting and more successful, responsible sessions.
