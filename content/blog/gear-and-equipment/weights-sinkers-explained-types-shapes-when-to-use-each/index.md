Weights and sinkers control depth, fall rate, bottom contact, and rig stability.

While jig heads integrate weight and hook together, separate sinkers allow more flexible rigging systems.

Understanding sinker shape and function helps you fine-tune presentation instead of simply adding more grams.

## What a Sinker Actually Does

A sinker adds mass to your rig to:

- Increase casting distance
- Control descent speed
- Maintain bottom contact
- Stabilize bait in current

Unlike jig heads, sinkers are often independent from the hook.

This allows sliding rigs and adjustable systems.

## Bullet Weights (Texas Rig Style)

Bullet weights are cone-shaped and typically used for weedless soft plastic presentations.

Advantages:

- Slides through cover efficiently
- Minimizes snagging
- Compact profile

Best for:

- Texas rigs
- Heavy vegetation
- Wood structure

Their tapered nose reduces resistance in grass and timber.

## Egg Sinkers

Egg sinkers are oval and allow line to pass through the center.

Advantages:

- Creates sliding rigs
- Fish feel less resistance on pickup
- Effective for bottom bait presentations

Best for:

- Live bait
- Carolina rigs
- Bottom fishing

Sliding function increases natural presentation.

## Split Shot Weights

Split shots are small pinch-on weights.

Advantages:

- Quick depth adjustment
- Fine-tuning for finesse
- Minimal profile

Best for:

- Light current
- Subtle presentations
- Adjusting sink rate precisely

They are ideal when only minor weight increase is needed.

## Drop Shot Weights

Drop shot weights are elongated and designed for vertical control.

Advantages:

- Maintains vertical alignment
- Reduces rolling on bottom
- Quick depth adjustment via clip system

Best for:

- Vertical finesse fishing
- Deep water
- Suspended fish targeting

Their slim shape improves bottom stability.

## Weight Shape and Bottom Contact

Shape determines how a weight interacts with structure.

Round weights:

- Roll more easily
- Less stable on slope

Flat or elongated weights:

- Resist rolling
- Maintain bottom contact

Match shape to bottom composition.

## Weight Selection and Current

Current increases drag and lifts lighter weights.

In moving water:

- Step up weight incrementally
- Maintain bottom feel without overpowering presentation

The lightest effective weight remains the ideal choice.

## Lead vs Alternative Materials

Traditional sinkers are lead.

However, alternatives include:

- Tungsten
- Steel
- Bismuth

Tungsten is:

- Denser than lead
- Smaller profile for same weight
- More sensitive due to hardness

Denser materials increase bottom feedback but cost more.

## Common Mistakes

Using Excessive Weight

Reduces natural bait movement.

Ignoring Shape for Structure

Wrong shape increases snag risk.

Failing to Adjust for Wind

Wind creates line bow and reduces bottom contact.

## Final Thoughts

Sinkers allow precise depth and control adjustments.

Choose weight based on environment and current.
Choose shape based on structure interaction.
