## How can we help?

Fishing Moments is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. If you need assistance, you'll find answers to common questions below.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the forecast work?
Fishing Moments calculates activity scores for each species based on multiple environmental factors: solunar periods (moon position), barometric pressure, water temperature estimates, wind, precipitation, and species-specific biological rhythms. Each species has its own behavior model reflecting its real sensitivity to these conditions.

### Why are forecasts different for each species?
Because fish don't all react the same way. Pike love cold fronts and pressure drops. Carp prefer warm, stable weather. Trout are sensitive to water temperature. Our models are calibrated per species to reflect these real biological differences.

### How accurate are the forecasts?
The forecasts are based on well-established ichthyological research and solunar theory. While no prediction can be 100% accurate (fishing remains fishing!), our users report significantly better catch rates when following the app's recommendations.

### What species are covered?
Fishing Moments covers 44 freshwater species including pike, zander, perch, carp, trout, catfish, and many more. The species catalog is adapted for each country.

### Which countries are supported?
The app supports 19 European countries: 🇫🇷 France, 🇬🇧 UK, 🇩🇪 Germany, 🇪🇸 Spain, 🇮🇹 Italy, 🇸🇪 Sweden, 🇳🇴 Norway, 🇫🇮 Finland, 🇩🇰 Denmark, 🇳🇱 Netherlands, 🇧🇪 Belgium, 🇨🇭 Switzerland, 🇦🇹 Austria, 🇵🇱 Poland, 🇨🇿 Czech Republic, 🇭🇺 Hungary, 🇭🇷 Croatia, 🇮🇪 Ireland, and 🇵🇹 Portugal. Each country has scientifically studied species catalogs adapted to local environments.

### How do I add a fishing spot?
Tap the map icon, then long-press on the map at your desired location. You can also use the search bar to find a location by name. Each spot saves its GPS coordinates for precise weather data.

### What's included in Premium?
Free users get today's forecast. Premium unlocks 10-day forecasts, unlimited spots, and access to all species data. Premium is available as a monthly or yearly subscription.

### How do I restore my purchase?
Go to Settings in the app, then tap "Restore Purchase". This will restore your Premium subscription if you've already purchased one.

### The app shows wrong weather data
Make sure your fishing spot is placed at the correct location. The app uses the spot's GPS coordinates to fetch weather data from the nearest station. Try moving the spot if the data seems off.
