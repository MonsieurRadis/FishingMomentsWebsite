## Introduction

Fishing Moments ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application Fishing Moments (the "App") and our website fishingmoments.eu (the "Website").

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
The App uses your device's GPS to provide localized fishing forecasts and weather data for your fishing spots. **Location data is processed locally on your device and is not sent to our servers.** Your saved spots are stored only on your device.

### Weather Data
The App fetches weather forecast data from third-party weather APIs based on the GPS coordinates of your fishing spots. These requests contain only geographic coordinates, not personal information.

### Purchase Information
If you subscribe to Fishing Moments Premium, your purchase is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information. Purchase validation is handled through RevenueCat, which receives only anonymous subscription status data.

### Website Analytics
Our website may use privacy-friendly analytics to understand traffic patterns. No personal data is collected through the website.

### Advertising (Website Only)
Our website uses Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google AdSense may use cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your browsing activity. You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). For more information about how Google uses data, see [Google's Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do **not** collect your name, email address, or phone number through the App
- We do **not** track your location in the background
- We do **not** create user accounts
- We do **not** sell or share any personal data with third parties
- We do **not** use advertising trackers in the App

## How We Use Information

The limited information we process is used solely to:
- Provide accurate weather forecasts for your fishing spots
- Validate Premium subscription status
- Improve the App based on aggregated, anonymous usage patterns

## Data Storage

All your App data (fishing spots, favorites, preferences) is stored **locally on your device**. We do not operate servers that store user data. If you delete the App, all local data is permanently removed.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:
- **Open-Meteo** — Weather forecast data (no personal data shared, only GPS coordinates)
- **RevenueCat** — Subscription management (anonymous purchase validation)
- **Apple App Store** — Payment processing

Each of these services has their own privacy policy that governs their use of data.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App does not require account creation or personal data entry.

## Your Rights

Under GDPR and applicable data protection laws, you have the right to:
- **Access** any personal data we hold about you
- **Delete** your data (since data is stored locally, you can delete it by removing the App)
- **Object** to data processing
- **Portability** of your data

Since we store virtually no personal data on our servers, most of these rights are automatically satisfied.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
