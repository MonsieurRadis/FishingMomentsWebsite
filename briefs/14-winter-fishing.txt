META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Winter doesn't mean stop fishing. Learn cold water strategies, the best species to target, and how to find the narrow feeding windows that produce results.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Winter Fishing Is Not Dead — It's Just Different
- Most fish don't stop feeding, they feed LESS and in shorter windows
- The key is precision timing — you need to be there during the window
- Fewer anglers = less pressure = bigger fish are less wary
- Some species actually fish better in winter (pike, perch, zander)

H2: The Midday Window
- In winter, midday IS prime time (opposite of summer)
- 11h-15h: when water reaches its daily maximum temperature
- Even 0.5-1°C warming can trigger a feed
- Don't arrive at dawn in winter — arrive at 10am
- Short but intense: the window may only be 2-3 hours

H2: Best Winter Species
- **Pike**: excellent in winter — slow but catchable, deadbaits shine
- **Perch**: still feed in cold water, small jigs at depth
- **Zander**: cold water doesn't stop them, just slows them
- **Grayling**: actually THRIVE in cold water — winter specialist
- **Trout**: active all winter in rivers with steady temperature
- **Carp/tench/bream**: possible but very difficult, micro-windows only

H2: Cold Water Fish Behavior
- Metabolism drops dramatically — fish need less food
- When they DO feed, they want easy meals (no chasing)
- Fish congregate in deeper, more stable water
- Slow movements, subtle bites — watch your rod tip/line closely
- Fish will travel less distance to take a bait — accuracy matters

H2: Winter Techniques
- Dead bait for pike: THE winter method — no energy cost for the pike
- Small jigs (3-5cm) for perch: vertical or micro-jigging
- Maggots/bloodworm for roach, perch, grayling: classic winter bait
- Slow retrieves for everything — half the speed you think is slow enough
- Drop shot: keep the lure in the strike zone longer

H2: Winter Weather Opportunities
- Mild spell after cold: feeding trigger — fish take advantage of warmth
- Stable mild weather (5-10°C): best winter conditions
- Frost followed by sunshine: midday window opens
- Avoid: rapidly falling temperature, strong cold wind, snow
- Surprisingly: overcast 6-8°C with light SW wind = winter jackpot

H2: Gear and Comfort
- Dress for staying still — you'll be sitting, not walking
- Hand warmers, thermal seat, hot drinks
- Lighter lines: clear cold water = spooky fish, scale down tackle
- Barbless hooks: cold hands fumble with barbed hooks, faster unhooking

CTA FINAL:
"Winter fishing rewards those who time it right. The window is narrow — but Fishing Moments pinpoints it. It tracks temperature trends, pressure changes, and species-specific cold water behavior to show you the exact hours worth fishing. No more sitting in the cold hoping for the best."
