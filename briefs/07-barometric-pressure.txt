META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Barometric pressure is one of the biggest factors in fish activity. Learn how rising, falling, and stable pressure affect fish — and when to go fishing.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: What Is Barometric Pressure?
- The weight of the atmosphere pressing down on the water
- Measured in hPa (hectopascals) or inHg (inches of mercury)
- Normal range: 1010-1025 hPa
- Changes with weather systems — fronts cause rapid shifts
- Fish detect even tiny changes through their swim bladder and lateral line

H2: How Fish Detect Pressure Changes
- Swim bladder acts like a barometer — it expands when pressure drops, compresses when it rises
- Lateral line picks up pressure wave changes
- Fish feel pressure changes BEFORE the weather arrives
- This is why fishing can be great before a storm and dead after

H2: Falling Pressure (Before a Storm)
- THE best time to fish — almost universally
- Fish sense the approaching front and feed aggressively
- Works for predators (pike, perch, zander) and cyprinids (carp, bream)
- The feeding window: 6-12 hours before the front arrives
- Fast-falling pressure = intense but short window
- Slow-falling pressure = longer, steadier feeding period

H2: Low Stable Pressure
- Underrated — many anglers only focus on falling pressure
- Once pressure stabilizes at a low level, fish adapt and resume feeding
- Overcast, mild conditions often accompany low pressure
- Good for bottom feeders and cruising predators
- Not explosive like falling pressure, but consistent

H2: Rising Pressure (After a Storm)
- Generally the worst time to fish
- Fish become lethargic as the front passes
- The "dead zone": 12-24 hours after a cold front
- Recovery time varies by species (pike recover faster than carp)
- Exception: very slow, gradual rise can be okay

H2: High Stable Pressure
- Clear skies, sunny, calm — classic "bluebird" conditions
- Moderate fishing — fish are active but cautious
- Best approach: early morning, go deeper, use natural presentations
- Not bad, just not peak — fish feed in shorter windows

H2: Pressure Trends vs. Absolute Numbers
- The TREND matters more than the exact reading
- A reading of 1015 hPa means nothing without context
- 1020 → 1015 (falling) = fish feeding
- 1010 → 1015 (rising) = fish recovering
- Track pressure over 24-48h, not just the current number

H2: Practical Tips for Using Pressure Data
- Check weather forecasts for approaching fronts
- Fish BEFORE the front, not during or after
- After a front: wait 12-24h before going out
- Multiple stable days = consistent but not explosive fishing
- "Fishing Moments tracks barometric pressure trends and factors them into species-specific scores. It knows that pike respond faster to pressure drops than carp — and adjusts your forecast accordingly."

CTA FINAL:
"Barometric pressure is the invisible force behind your best (and worst) fishing days. Fishing Moments monitors pressure trends in real time for your saved spots and weighs them into species-specific activity scores — because a zander doesn't react to pressure the same way a trout does."
