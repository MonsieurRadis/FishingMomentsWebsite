OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: What Makes Zander Different
- Zander (pikeperch) are the ghost of freshwater — shy, nocturnal, sensitive to light
- Unlike pike, they hunt in packs and prefer murky water
- Found across Europe in lakes, rivers, canals, and reservoirs
- Excellent table fish — one of the most prized catches in Europe

H2: Where to Find Zander
- Deep water with structure: drop-offs, submerged trees, bridge pilings
- Murky/turbid water preferred (zander have tapetum lucidum — great night vision)
- River: slow sections, deep bends, dam tailwaters
- Lakes: deep edges, 3-8m depth, near slopes
- Canals: lock walls, moored boats, any depth change

H2: Best Times to Fish for Zander
- Low-light specialist: dawn, dusk, and night are prime
- Overcast days can produce all-day action
- Best seasons: fall (September-November) and late winter/early spring
- Avoid bright midday sun — zander retreat to deep cover
- Solunar minor/major periods coincide with zander movement

H2: Techniques That Work
- **Vertical jigging**: #1 technique from a boat — soft lures on jig heads
- **Slow dragging**: from bank — weighted soft lure dragged along the bottom
- **Dead bait**: on the bottom — small roach or smelt
- **Drop shot**: finesse technique for pressured fish
- Key: keep it SLOW — zander take prey gently, not aggressively
- Rod tip bites, not rod-bending strikes

H2: Tackle Essentials for Zander
- Rod: 2.1-2.7m, 7-28g casting weight, sensitive tip
- Line: 0.12-0.15mm braid + fluorocarbon leader
- Lures: 7-12cm soft plastic shads in natural colors (white, pearl, grey, olive)
- Jig heads: 7-20g depending on depth and current
- Hooks: sharp — zander have bony mouths

H2: Common Beginner Mistakes
- Fishing too fast — zander want SLOW
- Using lures too big or too flashy (that's for pike)
- Striking too hard on the bite — just tighten, don't yank
- Ignoring low-light periods
- Not fishing deep enough

H2: Reading Conditions for Zander
- Murky water after rain: excellent
- Stable or falling pressure: good
- Wind creating chop: helps (reduces light penetration)
- "Fishing Moments gives you zander-specific forecasts — it factors in light, pressure, temperature, and solunar data, because zander react differently than pike or perch."

CTA FINAL:
"Zander reward patience and timing. They follow precise patterns based on light, pressure, and water conditions. Fishing Moments gives you species-specific forecasts for zander — so you know whether it's worth heading out or better to wait."
