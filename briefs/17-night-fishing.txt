META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Night fishing opens a whole new world. Learn which species are most active after dark, essential safety tips, and techniques that work in the dark.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Fish at Night?
- Many species are primarily nocturnal feeders
- Less fishing pressure — you have the water to yourself
- Big fish (trophy carp, catfish) feed more confidently after dark
- Summer: night may be the ONLY comfortable window (cool temps)
- It's a completely different, immersive experience

H2: Best Species for Night Fishing
- **Catfish/Wels**: the #1 night fish — apex nocturnal predator
- **Carp**: big carp patrol margins after dark, bold feeding
- **Eel**: almost exclusively nocturnal
- **Zander**: tapetum lucidum gives them night vision advantage
- **Tench**: classic dawn fish, but active through the night too
- **Trout**: in summer, night fishing avoids warm-water stress
- **NOT recommended**: pike (poor night vision, rarely feed after dark)

H2: Moon Phase and Night Fishing
- New moon (dark nights): best for most species — darkness = confidence
- Full moon: bright nights — zander and predators do well, carp less so
- Overcast nights (any moon phase): often the best — total darkness
- Moonrise/moonset: solunar minor periods — worth noting
- Link to moon phases article

H2: Best Night Fishing Techniques
- **Carp**: ledgered boilies, pellets, or corn on the bottom — bite alarms essential
- **Catfish**: large dead bait or live bait on the bottom, strong tackle
- **Zander**: slow soft lure retrieves, glow-in-dark jig heads
- **Eel**: worm on the bottom, simple running rig
- **General**: keep it simple — night is not the time for complex rigs
- Sound location: use bite alarms, sensitive rod tips, slack line indicators

H2: Essential Night Fishing Gear
- Headlamp: RED light mode to preserve your night vision
- Bite alarms: for static rod fishing (carp, catfish)
- Glow sticks / illuminated floats: for float fishing
- Reflective or luminous line markers
- First aid kit: more important at night
- Fully charged phone
- Bank sticks and rod rests: organized setup prevents tangles in the dark

H2: Safety First
- Tell someone where you're going and when you'll be back
- Know the water — visit during daylight first, note hazards
- Don't fish alone at night if you're a beginner
- Wear non-slip shoes — wet banks are dangerous in the dark
- Be aware of wildlife (snakes in some regions)
- Keep a whistle for emergencies
- Check regulations: some waters don't allow night fishing

H2: Planning Your Night Session
- Arrive before dark — set up in daylight
- Pre-bait your spots during the day if possible
- Prime time: typically 22h-02h for most species, then 04h-sunrise
- Quiet approach: fish hear you better when it's calm at night
- "Fishing Moments shows you hour-by-hour activity scores through the night — so you know if it's worth staying until 2am or packing up at midnight."

CTA FINAL:
"Night fishing rewards preparation and patience. Fishing Moments gives you species-specific activity scores through every hour of the night — factoring in moon phase, pressure, and temperature — so you know exactly when the bite window opens after dark."
