META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Catch and release keeps fish populations healthy — but only if done right. Learn the best practices to ensure fish survive after release.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Catch and Release Matters
- Fish populations are under pressure from overfishing, pollution, habitat loss
- C&R allows anglers to enjoy fishing while preserving stocks
- Done properly, survival rates are 90-95%+
- Done poorly, fish die hours or days after release
- It's our responsibility as anglers

H2: Before You Fish: Set Up for Success
- Use barbless hooks (or crimp barbs flat) — faster, cleaner unhooking
- Have your unhooking tools ready: forceps, pliers, disgorger
- Prepare your landing net — a rubberized mesh is gentlest on fish
- Have a wet unhooking mat if fishing for larger fish (carp, pike)
- Don't use stainless steel hooks (they don't dissolve if a fish breaks off)

H2: During the Fight
- Don't play fish to exhaustion — use appropriate tackle strength
- Bring fish in steadily, don't let them fight for 10+ minutes unnecessarily
- Oversized gear is better than undersized for C&R (shorter fight)
- In warm water (20°C+): this is critical — exhausted fish in warm water die

H2: Handling the Fish
- WET your hands before touching ANY fish — dry hands strip their slime coat
- Support the fish horizontally — never hold by the jaw alone (except bass)
- Keep fingers away from gills — gill damage is often fatal
- Minimize air exposure: 30 seconds max out of water
- If photographing: prepare the camera FIRST, then lift the fish briefly
- Hold fish low over water or mat — dropping from height = internal injuries

H2: Unhooking
- Lip-hooked fish: quick and easy, gently back the hook out
- Deep-hooked fish: use a disgorger or long forceps, DON'T pull
- If the hook is in the gills or stomach: cut the line close — the hook will corrode out
- Trying to remove a deep hook does more damage than leaving it
- Barbless hooks make ALL unhooking easier and safer

H2: Releasing the Fish
- Hold the fish upright in the water, facing into any current
- Support the belly — let the fish recover its balance
- Wait until the fish kicks away under its own power
- Don't throw or drop fish back in
- In rivers: release in calm water, not the main current (tired fish get swept away)
- If the fish rolls belly-up: gently right it and keep supporting

H2: Temperature Considerations
- Warm water (above 20°C): fish are already stressed, handle even faster
- Consider not fishing for sensitive species (trout) in very warm water
- Cold water: fish recover slower but are less stressed
- Air temperature matters too — don't lay fish on hot ground or rocks

H2: Keepnets, Sacks, and Retaining
- If you must retain fish: use a large keepnet in deep water
- Don't keep fish in small containers or buckets
- Carp sacks: only in cool water, for short periods
- Best practice: catch, unhook, photograph, release — no retaining needed

CTA FINAL:
"Every fish you release properly is one that breeds, grows, and gives another angler a great day. Fishing Moments helps you fish at the right times — which means less time waiting and more successful, responsible sessions."
