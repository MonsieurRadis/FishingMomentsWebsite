META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Water temperature controls trout behavior. Learn the ideal ranges for brown trout feeding, how seasons shift their patterns, and when to fish each zone.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Temperature Rules Trout Fishing
- Trout are cold-water species — they need dissolved oxygen
- Warm water holds less oxygen → trout stress and stop feeding
- Unlike carp, trout don't tolerate heat — they'll die above 25°C
- Temperature dictates where trout position, when they feed, and how aggressive they are

H2: Ideal Temperature Ranges for Brown Trout
- Peak activity: 12-18°C (54-64°F)
- Active feeding: 8-20°C (46-68°F)
- Stress zone: above 20°C — reduced feeding, seek cold pockets
- Danger zone: above 24°C — risk of mortality, avoid fishing (ethical)
- Cold but active: 4-8°C — slow, midday only, nymph/slow presentations

H2: How Temperature Affects Trout Behavior by Season
- Spring: water warming from winter → trout become increasingly active, insect hatches begin
- Summer: early morning and late evening only in lowland rivers; high-altitude streams stay fishable all day
- Fall: cooling water re-energizes trout, pre-spawn feeding frenzy
- Winter: trout still feed (unlike many species) but very selectively, slow metabolism

H2: Finding the Right Temperature Zone
- In rivers: cold tributaries, spring-fed sections, deep pools
- In lakes: thermocline — trout sit where temperature + oxygen balance
- Shaded banks stay cooler — target these in summer
- After rain: cooler runoff can reactivate trout in warm periods

H2: Temperature Trends vs. Absolute Numbers
- A warming trend (even within the optimal range) increases activity
- A sudden cold snap shuts down feeding for 24-48h
- Gradual cooling in fall = steady improvement
- 2°C rise overnight = potential feeding window even in winter

H2: Using Temperature Data to Plan Your Trip
- Check water temperature forecasts, not just air temp
- Water temp lags behind air temp by 12-24h
- "Fishing Moments models water temperature based on air temp, cloud cover, and season for each species — and shows you when trout activity peaks."

CTA FINAL:
"Brown trout are temperature-driven fish. A few degrees make the difference between an empty net and a great session. Fishing Moments factors in water temperature models specific to trout, combined with weather and solunar data, to show you the best fishing windows — hour by hour."
