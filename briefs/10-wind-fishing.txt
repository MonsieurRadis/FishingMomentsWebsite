TITLE: How Wind Affects Fishing: Direction, Speed & Strategy
SLUG: how-wind-affects-fishing
TARGET KEYWORD: wind and fishing
SECONDARY KEYWORDS: best wind direction for fishing, wind speed fishing, fishing in the wind, windward bank fishing
TARGET LENGTH: 1200-1500 words (~120-150 lines)

META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Wind direction and speed change where fish feed and how active they are. Learn which wind is best, why the windward bank works, and how to adapt.

OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Wind Matters More Than You Think
- Wind pushes food, oxygenates water, and creates cover (surface chop)
- It moves warm/cold water layers around in lakes
- Wind is directly tied to pressure systems (they arrive together)
- Most anglers avoid wind — but the best catches often come on windy days

H2: Wind Direction: The Old Saying That's Actually True
- "Wind from the west, fish bite best" — largely accurate
- Southwest/West wind: warm, associated with low/falling pressure → great fishing
- North/Northeast wind: cold, associated with rising/high pressure → poor fishing
- South wind: warm, can be excellent, especially in spring
- East wind: generally poor in Europe ("Wind from the east, fish bite least")
- The reason: wind direction correlates with weather fronts and temperature

H2: Wind Speed: How Much Is Too Much?
- Calm (0-5 km/h): poor — flat water, fish spooky, too much light penetration
- Light breeze (5-15 km/h): ideal — surface chop, comfortable fishing
- Moderate (15-25 km/h): good for fish, challenging for angler
- Strong (25+ km/h): fish may feed hard but fishing becomes difficult/dangerous
- The sweet spot: 10-20 km/h with a SW direction

H2: The Windward Bank Effect
- Wind pushes surface water (and food) toward one bank
- Insects, algae, daphnia, baitfish accumulate on the windward side
- Predators follow the food chain → fish the windward bank
- This effect is strongest on larger lakes
- Exception: very cold wind — then the sheltered bank may be warmer

H2: Wind and Waves: Creating Opportunities
- Surface chop reduces light penetration → fish feel safer in shallows
- Waves oxygenate the water → increases fish metabolism
- Murky water stirred up by wind → advantages ambush predators
- Drift fishing with the wind is a deadly technique (lure covers water naturally)

H2: Adapting Your Technique to Wind
- Heavier lures/sinkers to maintain contact in the wind
- Cast with the wind for distance, or across it for control
- Float fishing: use heavier floats, waggler style
- Bank fishing: position yourself so the wind is at your back or side
- Boat fishing: use a drift sock or anchor on the windward side

H2: Using Wind Data to Plan Sessions
- Check wind forecast for direction AND speed
- Look for days with SW 10-20 km/h
- Avoid calm high-pressure days (fish are lethargic and spooky)
- "Fishing Moments factors wind speed and direction into its forecasts for each of your saved spots — so you know which spot will fish best on any given day."

CTA FINAL:
"Wind is one of the most underrated factors in fishing. The right breeze can turn a dead lake into a feeding frenzy. Fishing Moments tracks wind conditions for your specific spots and factors them into species-specific activity scores — so you always know where and when to fish."
