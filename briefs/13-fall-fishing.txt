META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Fall is the best fishing season — and here's why. Fish feed aggressively before winter. Learn which species peak in autumn and how to take advantage.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Fall Is the Best Season for Fishing
- Fish know winter is coming — they feed aggressively to build fat reserves
- Water temperature drops into the optimal zone for most species (10-18°C)
- Oxygen levels recover after summer heat
- Baitfish are concentrated — predators follow
- Fishing pressure drops (most people stop fishing) = less spooked fish

H2: Early Fall (September)
- Still warm, transitioning from summer patterns
- Dawn/dusk still important but midday fishing starts producing again
- Pike and perch become more active as water cools below 20°C
- Carp: last big feeding push before winter slowdown
- Trout: excellent — water cooling, pre-spawn energy

H2: Mid Fall (October)
- The PEAK — water temp 8-15°C, perfect for almost everything
- All-day fishing possible, especially on overcast days
- Pike: large fish caught consistently, feeding hard
- Perch: trophy season, big schools in deeper water
- Zander: becoming very active as light levels drop with shorter days

H2: Late Fall (November)
- Water getting cold (5-10°C), approach shifts
- Midday becomes the productive window again
- Predators still active but need slower presentations
- Cyprinids slowing down — carp bites become rare
- Last chance for trout before many seasons close

H2: Best Fall Species
- **Pike**: #1 fall fish — aggressive, big, in shallow AND deep water
- **Perch**: trophy perch are a fall specialty
- **Zander**: low light + cool water = peak zander
- **Brown trout**: pre-spawn feeding, powerful fish
- **Carp**: September/early October only — then they slow down

H2: Fall Weather Patterns
- Mild, overcast days: the dream — fish feed all day
- First cold fronts: trigger aggressive pre-front feeding
- Fog and mist mornings: often great fishing
- Indian summer (warm spell in October): carp/tench bonus window
- Steady falling pressure through autumn: consistent fishing

H2: Fall Techniques
- Bigger lures for pike (15-20cm): match the growing baitfish
- Jigs and soft plastics for perch/zander at depth
- Slow-rolled spinnerbaits: cover water and trigger reaction strikes
- Dead bait: increasingly effective as water cools
- Carp: high-protein boilies, fishmeal based

CTA FINAL:
"Fall is when fishing peaks — but the windows shift week by week as temperatures drop. Fishing Moments tracks these changes in real time and shows you exactly when each species hits peak activity during autumn. Don't miss the best fishing of the year."
