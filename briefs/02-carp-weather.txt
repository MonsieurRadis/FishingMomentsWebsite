META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Discover how weather conditions affect carp behavior. Learn which pressure, temperature, wind, and cloud patterns make carp feed — and which shut them down.

OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Carp Are So Weather-Sensitive
- Carp are cold-blooded — metabolism directly tied to water temperature
- Lateral line detects pressure changes before we feel them
- Unlike predators, carp feed based on comfort, not aggression
- Understanding weather = understanding carp mood

H2: Barometric Pressure and Carp
- Falling pressure (before a storm): feeding increases — carp sense the change
- Low stable pressure: good, carp stay active
- Rising pressure (after a front): carp go quiet, can take 12-24h to recover
- High stable pressure: moderate activity, fish deeper
- The TREND matters more than the number

H2: Temperature: The #1 Factor
- Carp's optimal feeding range: 15-25°C (59-77°F)
- Below 10°C: metabolism drops, feed very little
- Below 5°C: almost dormant, only midday micro-windows
- Above 25°C: feed at night and early morning only
- Warming trends (even 1-2°C rise) trigger feeding binges

H2: Wind Direction and Carp
- Southwest wind (in Europe): warm, generally best
- Northeast/East wind: cold, usually poor
- "Wind from the west, fish bite best. Wind from the east, fish bite least."
- Wind pushes food (and warmer water) to one bank — fish the windward bank
- Light to moderate wind > dead calm (oxygenation)

H2: Cloud Cover, Rain & Storms
- Overcast: excellent for carp — they feel safer feeding in open water
- Light warm rain: one of the best conditions (oxygen + food washed in)
- Heavy cold rain: poor — temperature drop kills it
- Thunderstorms: carp often feed aggressively before, go dead during/after
- Bright sun: carp stick to cover, shaded areas, deeper water

H2: Putting It All Together
- The perfect carp day: mild temp, overcast, light SW wind, falling/stable pressure
- Use a multi-factor approach, not just one indicator
- "Fishing Moments combines pressure trends, temperature, wind, and cloud cover into a single carp-specific score — saving you from checking 5 apps."

CTA FINAL:
"Carp respond to weather changes before you even notice them. Fishing Moments tracks every factor that affects carp behavior — pressure trends, temperature shifts, wind, and more — and gives you an hour-by-hour activity score so you can plan your session around the fish, not guesswork."
