META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Rivers are full of fish — if you know where to look. Learn how to read a river, find the best spots, and understand where different species hold.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Rivers Are Not Random — Fish Have Addresses
- Every river has a structure: pools, riffles, runs, eddies
- Fish position themselves based on current, food, shelter, and oxygen
- Once you learn to read a river, you can find fish on ANY river
- It's the most transferable skill in fishing

H2: Understanding River Anatomy
- **Riffles**: shallow, fast, rocky — oxygenated, attracts insects
  → Trout, grayling, small perch
- **Runs**: moderate depth, steady current — the highway for fish
  → Barbel, chub, trout
- **Pools**: deep, slow — rest areas and holding spots
  → Pike, zander, large carp, catfish
- **Eddies**: where current swirls behind obstacles
  → Food collects here, all species visit
- **Glides**: smooth, even-paced water — often deceivingly deep
  → Excellent for chub, roach, dace

H2: Key Features That Hold Fish
- Overhanging trees: shade, falling insects, cover
- Undercut banks: hidden shelter, especially for trout and chub
- Fallen trees / log jams: predator ambush points (pike, perch)
- Confluence (where a tributary enters): temperature/oxygen change = fish magnet
- Bridge pilings: current break, shade, depth change
- Weir pools: oxygenated, deep, home to almost every species

H2: Reading Current for Fish Position
- Fish face upstream — they wait for food to come to them
- They hold where current is slightly slower than the main flow
- Behind rocks, in front of obstacles, along current seams
- The "seam": where fast water meets slow water — the food lane
- Cast upstream of where you think fish are, let bait drift naturally

H2: Species-Specific River Spots
- **Trout**: riffles, runs, pools with overhead cover
- **Barbel**: gravel runs, downstream of weirs, strong current
- **Pike**: slack water, backwaters, behind structures
- **Chub**: under trees, near structure, any food-rich area
- **Zander**: deep pools, murky stretches, dam tailwaters
- **Grayling**: clean gravel runs, well-oxygenated stretches

H2: Seasonal River Changes
- Spring: rising water levels, fish move to margins, use flooded areas
- Summer: low water concentrates fish in pools and deeper runs
- Fall: rain raises water — fish spread out, colored water = great fishing
- Winter: fish hold in the deepest, slowest sections
- After rain/floods: fish the edges and slack water, not the main torrent

H2: Practical Tips for Exploring a New River
1. Walk upstream before fishing — spot features from above
2. Polarized sunglasses: essential for seeing underwater structure
3. Start at obvious features: bridge, weir, confluence
4. Fish the far bank — it's almost always less pressured
5. Be mobile: move every 20-30 minutes if not catching
6. "Save your best river spots in Fishing Moments — each spot gets its own weather forecast based on exact GPS coordinates, not just city-level data."

CTA FINAL:
"River fishing is about reading the water and being in the right spot at the right time. Fishing Moments helps with the timing — species-specific forecasts based on real conditions at your exact river location. Save your spots, check the forecast, and fish smarter."
