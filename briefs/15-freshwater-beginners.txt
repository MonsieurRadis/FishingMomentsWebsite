New to freshwater fishing? This beginner's guide covers gear, species, techniques, and timing — everything you need to start catching fish today.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Welcome to Freshwater Fishing
- Fishing is one of the most accessible outdoor activities
- No need for expensive gear or expert knowledge to start
- This guide covers everything: gear, species, where, when, and how
- Focus on European freshwater (lakes, rivers, canals)

H2: Essential Gear for Beginners
- Rod & reel: a spinning combo (2.1-2.7m, 5-25g) covers 80% of situations
- Line: 0.20-0.25mm monofilament to start (forgiving, easy to handle)
- Hooks: size 6-10 for general use
- Floats: a few waggler floats for still water
- Weights: split shot assortment
- Landing net: essential for safe fish handling
- Tackle box: a small one with basics
- Budget: you can start for 50-100€

H2: Easy Species to Start With
- **Roach**: everywhere, bites anything, great to learn with
- **Perch**: aggressive, fun to catch, easy on lures or worms
- **Carp (small)**: powerful fighters, available in most waters
- **Bream**: bottom feeders, consistent on warm days
- **Trout** (stocked): in designated trout lakes, straightforward
- Avoid: pike/zander as absolute beginners (need specific tackle and technique)

H2: Where to Fish
- Local ponds and canals: easiest, most accessible
- Public lakes with fishing access
- Rivers: a bit more challenging but very rewarding
- Fishing permits: check local regulations (most European countries require a license)
- Fish near structure: reeds, overhanging trees, bridges, islands

H2: When to Fish
- Dawn and dusk: always the best (see dedicated article)
- Overcast days > sunny days for beginners (fish less shy)
- Avoid extreme weather (very cold, very hot, storms)
- Spring and fall: the most forgiving seasons
- "Fishing Moments can help even beginners pick the right day — it shows you which days have the highest fish activity score for your area."

H2: Basic Techniques
- **Float fishing**: the best starting technique
  - Float + hook + bait (worm, maggot, bread, corn)
  - Set depth so bait is near the bottom
  - Watch the float — when it dips, strike gently
- **Lure fishing**: for perch and small pike
  - Small spinners (3-5g Mepps or similar)
  - Cast, reel slowly, repeat
  - Feel for bites as taps in the rod
- **Ledgering**: bait on the bottom with a weight
  - Simple and effective for carp and bream
  - Cast out, tighten the line, wait for the rod tip to pull

H2: Fish Handling & Ethics
- Wet your hands before touching a fish
- Use a landing net — don't drag fish up the bank
- Unhook quickly and gently
- If keeping fish: check size limits and regulations
- If releasing: support the fish in the water until it swims away
- Respect the environment: take your trash, don't damage banks

H2: Next Steps: Getting Better
- Keep a fishing log (what, where, when, conditions)
- Try different species and techniques
- Learn to read water (link to article)
- Use tools that help you understand fish behavior
- Join local fishing communities
