META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Hot weather changes the rules. Learn how to adapt your summer fishing — best times, depths, species, and techniques to beat the heat and still catch fish.

OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Summer Is Tricky (But Not Impossible)
- Warm water = lower oxygen, stressed fish, changed feeding patterns
- Fish shift to dawn/dusk and deeper water
- Many anglers give up in summer — but the fish are still there
- The key: timing and location adjustment

H2: The #1 Rule: Fish Early, Fish Late
- Dawn (first light to +2h): the absolute best window in summer
- Dusk (sunset ± 1h): second best, fish feed before dark
- Midday in summer: avoid for most species (exceptions below)
- Night fishing: underrated option for carp, catfish, zander
- Be on the water at 5am, not 9am

H2: Go Deeper
- Thermocline forms in lakes — cooler, oxygenated water below the surface layer
- Fish the thermocline depth (typically 3-6m depending on the lake)
- Rivers: deep pools, shaded runs, near cold tributaries
- Under bridges, overhanging trees, dam walls = shade = fish

H2: Best Summer Species
- Carp: active all summer but switch to night/dawn feeding
- Catfish: summer is THEIR season — warm water, active nights
- Perch: early morning surface hunting, deep at midday
- Tench: classic dawn specialist, weed beds, margins
- Trout: ONLY in cold water (mountain streams, deep lakes, spring-fed rivers)
- Pike/zander: early morning or wait for fall

H2: Water Temperature Dangers
- Above 22°C: handle fish carefully, quick unhooking, no keepnets
- Above 25°C: consider not fishing for trout (mortality risk)
- Carry a thermometer or check water temp in your weather app
- Warm water = tired fish = higher post-release mortality
- Be an ethical angler: the fish's survival matters

H2: Summer Weather Opportunities
- Overcast summer days: THE jackpot — fish stay active longer
- Summer storms: excellent fishing before the front (falling pressure)
- After a heat wave breaks: 24-48h of incredible fishing as water cools
- Light summer rain: perfect — cools water, washes in food

H2: Summer Technique Adjustments
- Use smaller, more natural presentations
- Fish slower — metabolism is high but fish are lethargic in heat
- Topwater lures at dawn: deadly for pike and perch
- Live bait near the bottom for catfish at night
- Floating bread/dog biscuits for surface-feeding carp

CTA FINAL:
"Summer fishing is all about precision timing. Fishing Moments shows you the exact hours when fish will be active — even in the heat. It factors in water temperature models, dawn/dusk windows, and weather patterns to find the windows that others miss."
