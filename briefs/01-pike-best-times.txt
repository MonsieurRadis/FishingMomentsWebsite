META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Learn the best times to fish for pike by season, time of day, and weather. Science-backed tips to predict when pike are most active and feeding.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: When Are Pike Most Active?
- Pike are ambush predators — they don't feed constantly
- Most active during low-light conditions (dawn, dusk)
- Feeding windows tied to water temperature and prey activity
- Mention that solunar periods (major/minor) align with pike activity spikes

H2: Best Time of Day for Pike
- Early morning (sunrise to ~2h after): #1 window
- Late afternoon (2h before sunset): #2 window
- Midday: generally slow except overcast days or cold water periods
- Night: pike are less active than other predators at night

H2: Best Season for Pike Fishing
- Spring (post-spawn): aggressive feeding, shallow water, easy to target
- Summer: early morning only, pike go deep when water warms above 20°C
- Fall: THE best season — pike bulk up before winter, feed all day
- Winter: slow but possible, target midday when water is "warmest"

H2: How Weather Affects Pike Activity
- Barometric pressure: pike feed aggressively before a front (dropping pressure)
- Overcast days > sunny days (pike prefer low light)
- Light rain can trigger feeding
- Wind: a light chop on the water helps (breaks surface light)
- Stable weather patterns = more predictable pike behavior

H2: Water Temperature and Pike
- Optimal range: 10-18°C (50-65°F)
- Below 5°C: very sluggish, slow presentations needed
- Above 22°C: pike stressed, avoid catch & release (mortality risk)
- Temperature trends matter more than absolute temp (warming = good)

H2: How to Predict Pike Feeding Times
- Combine solunar calendar + weather + temperature
- Mention Fishing Moments as a tool that does this automatically
- "Instead of checking 5 different apps, tools like Fishing Moments combine all these factors into one score for pike specifically."

CTA FINAL:
"Pike don't feed randomly. Their activity follows predictable patterns driven by light, temperature, and pressure. Fishing Moments calculates pike-specific activity scores hour by hour, combining solunar data, weather forecasts, and species biology — so you know exactly when to be on the water."
