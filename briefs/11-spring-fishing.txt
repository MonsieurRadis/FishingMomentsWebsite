META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Spring is when freshwater fishing comes alive. Learn which species to target, the best times, and how warming water changes everything.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Spring Is a Game-Changer
- Water warming from winter dormancy triggers massive biological activity
- Insect hatches, spawning activity, feeding frenzies
- Fish that haven't eaten properly in months are hungry
- BUT: timing matters — too early and it's still winter, too late and it's summer rules

H2: Early Spring (March - Mid April)
- Water still cold (5-10°C), warming slowly
- Best time: midday (warmest part of the day)
- Target: pike (post-spawn, very aggressive), perch (shallow, hungry)
- Slow presentations still needed — fish metabolism is low
- Look for the warmest water: south-facing banks, shallow bays, dark-bottomed areas

H2: Late Spring (Mid April - May)
- Water hits 12-18°C — the magic zone for most species
- Dawn/dusk become the prime windows again
- Trout: insect hatches create incredible dry fly opportunities
- Carp: start feeding seriously, moving into shallows
- Perch: hunting packs reform, aggressive on lures
- Everything is active — it's the easiest time of year to catch fish

H2: Best Spring Species to Target
- Pike: #1 spring target — post-spawn aggression, shallow water, easy to find
- Perch: schooling, hitting small lures hard
- Trout: rising to hatches, active in streams and rivers
- Carp: warming water gets them moving, surface cruising begins
- Tench: classic spring fish — dawn bites in weedy shallows

H2: Spring Weather Patterns to Watch
- Warming trends are everything — a week of mild weather = fishing explosion
- Cold snaps in spring: devastating, can shut down fishing for days
- Rain: warm spring rain = excellent (washes food, oxygenates)
- Wind: SW wind in spring = perfect conditions
- Pressure: stable/falling after a warm spell = prime time

H2: Spring Techniques That Work
- Predators: slow-retrieved lures, jerkbaits near surface, shallow running crankbaits
- Carp: float fished bread, corn, or boilies in margins
- Trout: dry flies matching the hatch, small nymphs
- General: fish SHALLOWER than you think — fish move to warm water

H2: Planning Your Spring Sessions
- Watch the weather forecast for the first sustained warm spell
- Target sunny afternoons in early spring, dawn/dusk in late spring
- "Fishing Moments adapts to spring's changing conditions automatically — it shifts from winter-mode midday windows to summer-mode dawn/dusk as the season progresses."

CTA FINAL:
"Spring is unpredictable — one warm week followed by a cold snap. Fishing Moments tracks temperature trends, pressure changes, and species-specific seasonal shifts to tell you exactly when spring fishing switches on in your area."
