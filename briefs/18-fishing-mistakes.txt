META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Not catching fish? You might be making one of these 10 common mistakes. Simple fixes that instantly improve your fishing success rate.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Introduction
- Everyone makes mistakes when starting — it's part of learning
- But some mistakes are easy to fix once you know about them
- These 10 errors account for most blank sessions

H2: Mistake #1: Fishing at the Wrong Time
- Showing up at noon on a sunny summer day = worst timing possible
- Fix: fish dawn/dusk, check conditions before going
- "Even just using a basic forecast tool like Fishing Moments can show you which hours are worth fishing."

H2: Mistake #2: Too Much Noise
- Stomping on the bank, slamming car doors, loud conversations
- Fish feel vibrations through the ground and water
- Fix: approach quietly, move slowly, stay low near the water
- This alone can double your catch rate

H2: Mistake #3: Using the Wrong Bait or Lure Size
- Oversized lures for small fish, undersized for large
- Bright flashy lures when fish want natural
- Fix: match the hatch — use bait that looks like what fish eat naturally
- When in doubt: smaller is usually better

H2: Mistake #4: Fishing the Wrong Depth
- Bait floating 2m above where the fish are
- Fix: adjust float depth, use a plummet to find bottom depth
- In summer: fish deeper. In spring: fish shallower. Always test different depths

H2: Mistake #5: Not Changing Spots
- Sitting in the same swim for 4 hours with no bites
- Fix: if nothing in 30-45 minutes (lure fishing) or 1-2 hours (bait), move
- Fish don't come to you — you need to find them
- Exception: pre-baited carp swims (then patience pays)

H2: Mistake #6: Ignoring the Weather
- Going fishing regardless of conditions and blaming the fish
- Fix: check pressure trends, wind, temperature before going
- A "bad" day for fishing = less fish stress = just pick a better day

H2: Mistake #7: Line Too Thick / Tackle Too Heavy
- Heavy line is visible to fish, especially in clear water
- Fix: lightest line your target species allows
- Use fluorocarbon leaders if main line is braid (invisible underwater)

H2: Mistake #8: Setting the Hook Too Hard (or Too Soft)
- Yanking the rod on every twitch = missed fish or ripped hooks
- Not striking at all = fish spits the hook
- Fix: firm but controlled strike — tighten into the fish, don't swing for the fences

H2: Mistake #9: Poor Fish Handling
- Dry hands, squeezing, holding vertically, dragging on the ground
- Fix: wet hands, horizontal hold, support the belly, minimize air time
- Link to catch and release article

H2: Mistake #10: Not Learning from Each Session
- Going fishing without paying attention to what works and what doesn't
- Fix: keep a simple log — date, time, weather, what you caught, what didn't work
- Patterns emerge fast — the best anglers are the most observant

H2: Bonus: The Biggest Mistake of All
- Giving up after a few blank sessions
- Everyone blanks. Even experts blank.
- Fishing rewards persistence, curiosity, and willingness to adapt

CTA FINAL:
"Half of these mistakes come down to timing and conditions. Fishing Moments helps you avoid the biggest one — fishing at the wrong time. It gives you species-specific activity scores based on real data, so you spend your time on the water when it counts."
