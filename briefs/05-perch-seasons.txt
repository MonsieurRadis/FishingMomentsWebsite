META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Perch behavior changes dramatically with each season. Learn when perch are most active, where they move, and how to adapt your approach all year long.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Seasons Matter for Perch
- Perch are one of the most widespread freshwater species in Europe
- They're active year-round but their behavior shifts completely between seasons
- Location, depth, aggression, and feeding patterns all change
- Understanding the seasonal cycle = catching perch consistently

H2: Spring Perch (March - May)
- Post-spawn period: perch are hungry and aggressive
- They move to shallow, warmer areas (1-3m)
- Small lures and worms work well — perch hit hard
- Best time: midday (water warmest)
- Look for: reed edges, shallow bays, warm-water inflows
- Spring = the easiest season for perch

H2: Summer Perch (June - August)
- Perch form hunting packs and chase baitfish in open water
- Early morning surface action ("perch boils")
- Midday: drop deeper (3-6m) near structure
- Small crankbaits and spinners for surface; drop shot for depth
- Hot spells: fish very early or late
- Summer perch are aggressive but scattered — finding them is the challenge

H2: Fall Perch (September - November)
- THE trophy season — big perch feed heavily before winter
- Schools tighten up, often near drop-offs and deep structure
- Gradually moving deeper as temps fall
- Larger lures work now (8-10cm shads)
- Best overall season for numbers AND size
- Overcast days + stable pressure = all-day feeding

H2: Winter Perch (December - February)
- Perch slow down but still feed (unlike many cyprinids)
- Deep water: 4-8m, near bottom
- Very slow presentations: vertical jigging, small jigs, maggots
- Midday window (11h-15h) is the key period
- Don't expect rod-bending strikes — watch the line

H2: How Weather Interacts with Seasonal Patterns
- Each season has its own ideal weather conditions
- Spring: warming trend = feeding trigger
- Summer: overcast = perch stay active longer
- Fall: stable pressure = big perch feed confidently
- Winter: mild spells within cold periods = micro windows
- "Fishing Moments combines seasonal patterns with real-time weather to give you perch-specific forecasts — adapting automatically as conditions change."

CTA FINAL:
"Perch are catchable all year — if you adapt. Fishing Moments uses species-specific models for perch that account for seasonal rhythms, temperature, pressure, and solunar activity. It tells you exactly when perch will be active in your area, whatever the season."
