META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
What is solunar theory and does it actually predict fish activity? We break down the science, the data, and how to use it to catch more fish.

OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: What Is Solunar Theory?
- Developed by John Alden Knight in 1926
- Theory: fish (and wildlife) activity peaks at predictable times based on sun/moon positions
- 4 periods per day: 2 major (~2h each), 2 minor (~1h each)
- Major periods: moon overhead and moon underfoot
- Minor periods: moonrise and moonset
- Used by hunters and fishermen for nearly 100 years

H2: The Science Behind It
- Gravitational pull of moon/sun creates tidal forces (even in freshwater)
- Micro-tidal effects on lakes may influence zooplankton movement
- Light levels change with moon phase — affects prey/predator behavior
- Studies: several peer-reviewed papers show correlation (cite examples)
  - Florida largemouth bass study: 60%+ catches during solunar periods
  - Multiple European studies on lake fish movement patterns
- Skeptics say: correlation doesn't prove causation, weather may matter more

H2: Major vs. Minor Periods
- Major periods (~2h): strongest activity, often the best fishing windows
- Minor periods (~1h): secondary peaks, still notably better than random times
- Major periods coincide with moon transit (directly overhead/underfoot)
- These times shift ~50 min later each day (following the lunar cycle)
- Best: when a major period aligns with dawn or dusk

H2: Moon Phases and Solunar Strength
- New moon and full moon: strongest solunar effect (sun + moon aligned)
- First/third quarter: moderate effect
- The 3 days around new/full moon are often the best fishing of the month
- Full moon: controversial — great solunar but fish may feed at night instead
- New moon: consistently the best for daytime fishing

H2: Does It Actually Work?
- Short answer: yes, but it's ONE factor, not the only one
- Solunar theory works best when combined with:
  - Favorable weather (stable/falling pressure)
  - Appropriate temperature
  - Correct season
- Solunar alone won't save a bad weather day
- But on a neutral day, fishing during solunar periods gives you an edge
- Think of it as a multiplier, not a magic formula

H2: How to Use Solunar Data in Practice
- Check solunar times for your fishing date
- Plan to be on the water 30min BEFORE a major period starts
- Prioritize days where major period overlaps with dawn/dusk
- Combine with weather forecast for confidence
- "Fishing Moments integrates solunar calculations directly into its species-specific scores. You don't need to check a separate solunar calendar — it's already factored in, weighted by species."

CTA FINAL:
"Solunar theory is one piece of the puzzle — but it's a real one. Fishing Moments combines solunar major and minor periods with barometric pressure, temperature, wind, and species-specific biology into a single score. No need to cross-reference multiple calendars. Just open the app and see when your target species will be most active."
