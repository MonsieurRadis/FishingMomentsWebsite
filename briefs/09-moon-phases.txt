META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Does the moon really affect fishing? We look at the data behind full moon, new moon, and quarter phases — and what it means for your next trip.

----------------------------------------
OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: The Moon and Fish: Myth or Reality?
- Fishermen have tracked moon phases for centuries
- Science now has data to back (some of) it up
- The moon affects: gravitational pull, light levels, and tidal forces
- All three influence fish behavior — even in freshwater

H2: How Moon Phases Work (Quick Primer)
- New moon → first quarter → full moon → third quarter → cycle repeats (~29.5 days)
- New moon: moon between earth and sun, dark nights
- Full moon: moon opposite sun, bright nights
- Quarters: half-lit moon, moderate gravitational effect

H2: New Moon: The Best Phase for Daytime Fishing
- Strongest gravitational effect (sun + moon aligned = spring tides)
- Dark nights = fish don't feed overnight → hungry in the morning
- Consistently rated #1 by solunar theory practitioners
- Multiple studies confirm higher catch rates around new moon
- Best 3 days: day before, day of, day after new moon

H2: Full Moon: It's Complicated
- Same gravitational pull as new moon (aligned but opposite)
- BUT: bright nights mean fish feed after dark
- Daytime fishing can be slower (fish already fed)
- Night fishing under full moon: excellent for predators
- Common pattern: slower morning, good evening/night

H2: Quarter Moons: The Middle Ground
- Weaker gravitational effect (sun and moon at 90°)
- Generally average fishing — neither peak nor dead
- Can still produce good fishing when combined with good weather
- Don't skip fishing just because it's a quarter moon

H2: Moon Phase + Other Factors
- Moon phase alone won't make or break a session
- Best combo: new moon + falling pressure + dawn/dusk = peak
- Worst combo: post-full moon + rising pressure + midday sun = tough
- Weather overrides moon phase in most cases
- Think of moon phase as a 10-20% modifier, not a 100% factor
- "Fishing Moments weights moon phase into its scoring engine alongside pressure, temperature, and species behavior — so the moon influence is already baked into your forecast."

H2: Practical Moon Phase Calendar Tips
- Track 3 days around new moon as your "go-to" days each month
- On full moon nights: try night fishing for zander, catfish, big carp
- Don't cancel a trip because of moon phase — weather matters more
- But if you can choose WHEN to go, pick new moon ± 1 day

CTA FINAL:
"Moon phases are a real factor in fish activity — but they're not the only one. Fishing Moments integrates lunar data into species-specific scores, so you get one clear forecast instead of cross-referencing moon calendars, weather apps, and solunar tables."
