META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
Stop fishing random spots. Learn how to read a lake like a pro — find structure, depth changes, and fish-holding features that most anglers walk past.

OUTLINE:
----------------------------------------

H2: Why Reading a Lake Is the Most Important Skill
- You can have perfect gear, perfect bait, perfect timing
- But if you're casting into empty water, you'll catch nothing
- 90% of fish are in 10% of the water — your job is finding that 10%
- Learning to "read" a lake means identifying where fish live and feed

H2: Look for Structure
- Fish relate to structure — anything different from the surrounding lake bed
- Fallen trees, submerged branches, roots: predator ambush points
- Weed beds: food, oxygen, cover — magnets for all species
- Reed margins: especially in spring (spawning) and summer (shade)
- Man-made: jetties, boat moorings, dam walls, bridge pilings
- If it's different, fish are probably near it

H2: Find the Depth Changes
- Drop-offs are the most productive feature in any lake
- Fish patrol the edge where shallow meets deep
- Look for: color changes in water (dark = deep), slope of the bank continuing underwater
- Islands: the margins around islands are always worth fishing
- Points/peninsulas: where the bank juts out, depth drops off nearby

H2: Read the Surface
- Bubbles: fish feeding on the bottom release bubbles (carp, tench, bream)
- Rings/ripples: fish rising for insects (trout, roach, rudd)
- Baitfish jumping: predators below pushing them up
- Calm patches in wind-ruffled water: often indicates something underwater (weeds, shallows)
- Birds diving: follow the birds to find baitfish concentrations

H2: Wind and Current Patterns
- Windward bank (where wind blows TO): food accumulates, fish follow
- In larger lakes: wind creates a surface current that pushes food
- Current channels: some lakes have inflows/outflows — fish congregate near moving water
- After strong wind: the windward side holds more food and warmer water

H2: Seasonal Locations
- Spring: shallow, warm bays — south-facing banks, dark bottom areas
- Summer: deeper water, shade, near thermocline depth
- Fall: fish move between deep and shallow as they feed aggressively
- Winter: deepest, most stable areas — fish conserve energy

H2: Practical Tips for a New Lake
1. Walk the entire bank before fishing — look for features
2. Look for other anglers' worn spots (they fish there for a reason)
3. Use polarized sunglasses to see underwater structure
4. Cast to features, not open water
5. Try multiple spots — don't commit to the first swim
6. "Save your productive spots in Fishing Moments — it gives you weather data specific to each location so you know which spot to fish on any given day."

CTA FINAL:
"Finding fish is half the battle. Once you've found a productive spot, Fishing Moments lets you save it and get hyper-local weather and activity forecasts — so you know not just WHERE, but WHEN that spot will fish best."
