META DESCRIPTION (max 155 chars):
----------------------------------------
When do fish bite most? Discover the best times of day to fish, backed by science. Dawn, dusk, midday — learn what actually works and why.

OUTLINE:

H2: The Short Answer
- Dawn and dusk. Always has been, always will be.
- But the real answer depends on: species, season, weather, and water type
- This article explains WHY and WHEN the rules change

H2: Why Dawn and Dusk Are Prime Time
- Light transition triggers prey movement (insects, baitfish)
- Predators evolved to hunt in low light (pike, zander, perch)
- Water surface is calmer, fish feel safer in shallow water
- Temperature is often ideal (not too hot, not too cold)
- Solunar major periods frequently overlap with dawn/dusk

H2: Early Morning (Sunrise to +3h)
- #1 window for most species, especially in warm months
- Predators: actively hunting — topwater lures, spinners
- Carp/tench: morning feed after a night of cruising
- In summer: this may be your ONLY productive window
- Be on the water BEFORE sunrise, not at sunrise

H2: Late Afternoon / Dusk (3h Before Sunset)
- #2 window — almost as good as morning
- Some species actually prefer evening (catfish, eel, zander)
- Water has warmed all day — triggers activity in cold seasons
- In fall: the afternoon is often better than morning
- Fish feed knowing night is coming — urgency factor

H2: Midday (10h - 15h)
- Not dead water, despite the reputation
- Winter: midday IS the prime time (warmest water of the day)
- Overcast days: midday can be great year-round
- Deep water species stay active (zander, perch in lakes)
- In spring/fall: underrated window, especially on cloudy days

H2: Night Fishing
- Some species are primarily nocturnal: catfish, eel, large carp
- Zander: excellent at night (best low-light predator)
- Pike: rarely worth targeting at night
- Trout: can work during summer when days are too warm
- Full moon vs new moon: new moon = better (darker = more confidence)

H2: How Seasons Change the Best Time
- Spring: midday (warmth) → gradually shifts to dawn/dusk
- Summer: dawn/dusk ONLY in hot weather, early morning #1 priority
- Fall: all day can work, afternoons often peak
- Winter: midday window, 11h-15h, tight but productive

H2: The Real Answer: It Depends on Conditions
- Time of day is ONE factor among many
- The best time = dawn/dusk + good pressure + solunar period + right temperature
- When all factors align, it doesn't matter much what time it is
- When conditions are poor, even dawn won't save you
- "Fishing Moments combines time of day, solunar periods, weather, and species biology into one score. It shows you THE best hour to fish — not just a generic dawn/dusk recommendation."

CTA FINAL:
"The best time to fish is when everything lines up: light, weather, moon, and species biology. Fishing Moments calculates this for you — hour by hour, species by species, for your exact location. Stop guessing, start timing."
